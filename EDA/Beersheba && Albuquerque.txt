Beersheba is the largest city in the Negev desert of southern Israel. 
Often referred to as the "Capital of the Negev", it is the center of the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in Israel.


Albuquerque, New Mexico’s largest city, sits in the high desert.
Its modern Downtown core contrasts with Old Town Albuquerque, dating to the city’s 1706 founding as a Spanish colony.
